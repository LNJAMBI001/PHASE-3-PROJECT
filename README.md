### PHASE-3-PROJECT
A project that utilizes classification to analyse the likelihood of a subscriber churning a telecommunications company
## PROJECT OVERVIEW:
### BUSINESS PROBLEM UNDERSTANDING:
A telecommunication company aims at reducing cost by minimizing cost associated with customers who end up discontinuing their subscription services.

The main goals of the model and analysis is to improve subscribers satisfaction , through deriving insights from subscribers patterns, behaviors and preferences.

Additionally, the analysis aim at expanding the customer base by tailoring services that will attract new subscribers.

### DATA USED:
For this project, the following dataset was used:
- syriateldataset.csv

A detailed explanation of what each column represents is also attached.
### REPOSITORY CONTENT:
- A readme file
- A jupyter notebook containing all the technical presentation.
- A pdf file containing all the non technical presentations
- A csv file containg the dataset used
- A word document containing a detailed column description of the dataset.
### OBJECTIVES
1.Identify the attributes and services that have a higher likelihood of leading a client to churn the company.

2.Determine the possible measures that can be implemented to ensure that the clients donâ€™t churn the company.
